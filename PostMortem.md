# Project Post-Mortem

## Introduction
This post-mortem report provides an overview of what worked well and what did not work well for our team during Assignment 2. We also outline how we plan to address these issues for Assignment 3 and the final project.

## What Worked Well
- **Effective Communication:** Our team maintained open and regular communication through group chats, video calls, and project management tools. This ensured that everyone was on the same page and could discuss issues as they arose.

- **Clear Roles and Responsibilities:** We defined clear roles and responsibilities for each team member, which helped streamline the development process. Each member knew what was expected of them.

- **Git Workflow:** Following the defined Git workflow, including separate development branches and testing branches, helped keep our codebase organized and allowed for smooth integration of features.

- **Testing and Continuous Integration:** We implemented a testing process on the `test` branch, which helped identify and resolve issues early in the development cycle.

- **Documentation:** We maintained good documentation for our project, including a development document that outlined roles, responsibilities, and workflow.

## What Did Not Work Well
- **Testing Delays:** While we had a testing process in place, delays in testing and integration sometimes occurred, causing bottlenecks in development.

- **Merge Conflicts:** We encountered merge conflicts during integration, which led to some unanticipated issues and required additional time for resolution.

## Lessons Learned and Plans for Assignment 3 and the Final Project
To address the issues we faced in Assignment 2 and improve our processes for Assignment 3 and the final project, we plan to:

- **Regular Check-Ins:** Schedule regular check-in meetings to monitor progress and ensure that no team member is falling behind. Address issues promptly and redistribute tasks if necessary.

- **Testing Schedule:** Set up a testing schedule to ensure that testing and integration are completed in a timely manner. Consider implementing automated testing to reduce manual testing time.

- **Conflict Resolution:** Improve communication about potential conflicts and solutions. Encourage team members to perform `git pull` frequently to prevent merge conflicts.

- **Documentation Enhancement:** Enhance documentation by providing more detailed guidelines for the development workflow, branching, and coding standards.

- **Frequent Status Updates:** Team members will be encouraged to provide more frequent status updates, including what they are currently working on and any potential challenges they are facing.

By addressing these issues and implementing these changes, we aim to have a smoother and more efficient development process in Assignment 3 and the final project.
