## Part 1
- we should add a component in front-end to display all the available documents in the server, so that users can select the specific document name they want to use.

- When user select the document, we should handle the request from the front-end in the back-end server and return the contents of the specific document to front-end.

- When the front-end receive the response from the back-end, it should be able to display it correctly.

## Part 2
- In the front-end, we should add multiple buttons to handle all the new functionality.

- In the  back-end, we should modified the FormulaEvaluator to solve the new formula passed by the front-end.

## Part 3
- In the front-end, we should request the information that who are editing the which cell from the back-end server, and use css to display that information on the cells.

- In the back-end, we should send the information including the cell currently being edited by the users and the name of the user who is currently in edit mode to the front-end.

- we should also add the logic: When a cell is currently being edited, it can be viewed by other users while it cannot be edited by other users.
